# SignalRGB WIZ Network Plugin
This plugin adds a new network Interface to your SignalRGB Network Tab.
You need to activate the feature for local network communication inside your WIZ App

* It will start automatically to search for devices inside your home network.
* All found devices will automatically be added to your Device list as separate components. 
* The plugin will check every 60 seconds for new devices inside your network. 

#### This Plugin is still work-in-progress and I will try to continuously update the plugin with new devices and cover more features of WIZ lamps. 

## Things known for improvement needed
* Better names for device components
* Stabilise device discovery, which may crash SignalRGB sometimes
* Cleanup the mess of a code I wrote
* Add an option for turning off on shutdown
* Add images for device components
* Add support for white color temperatures
* Add support for device groups
* Add settings for discovery behavior as:
    * Discovery interval
    * Update interval
